# python-roster-generator
I developed this application using python - wx and pandas library. This application works on raw data to generate roster.

csoutreach.py - contains the main code for UI and all computation.
Setup.py      - need to convert py to exe.

to convert this application, you need all the dll's which are there in the src folder.
execute below command,

C:\python-roster-generator>python setup.py py2exe

this will create a dist folder, which will contain a exe file.
